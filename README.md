# reminder-app
### A cross-platform app which displays/saves reminders and can load/save the reminders from file. The app was written in Java and runs on [JVM](https://java.com/en). [Swing Framework](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/architecture-142923.html) was used for GUI components.

To run the app:

1. Make sure you have [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html) or [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) installed. 
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. In terminal run the following commands: `cd src && javac *.java` and `java ReminderMain &`.

## Description ##
In order to start a new session you will be prompted to either load a `.rem` file which already contains reminders data or you will be prompted to create a new `.rem` file at the beginning of the session.
